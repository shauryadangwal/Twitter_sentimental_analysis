# Twitter_sentimental_analysis
Based on tweets emotion is predicted.
Two datasets were there one is test dataset and train dataset.Dataset has id , label and tweet.
label 0 represented positive emotion and 1 represented negative. 
Task was not that if positive word is with not make it negative and if negative word is with not make it 
positive. Based on different tweets model was trained and prediction was made.
This analysis was done using Natural Language Toolkit and python.
I have used supervised learning model using python and NLP(natural language Processing)libraries
.Naive bayes classifier was used.

Removal of stopwords,punctuations ,hastags were done. Later normalzation was done.
Basically , after data  preprocessing model was fitted.
